  ## Description
  This challenge is to build a text editor that runs in a browser that meets the PWA criteria, data persistence techniques, and will be able to function online.
  ## Installation
1. Download or clone the repository
2. Node.js and IndexedDBb is required to use the application
3. Use npm install to install the necessary npm packages
  ## Usage
- GIVEN a text editor web application 
- WHEN I open my application in my editor 
- THEN I should see a client server folder structure WHEN I run `npm run start` from the root directory 
- THEN I find that my application should start up the backend and serve the client 
- WHEN I run the text editor application from my terminal 
- THEN I find that my JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack WHEN I run my webpack plugins 
- THEN I find that I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file WHEN I use next-gen JavaScript in my application - - THEN I find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors 
- WHEN I open the text editor 
- THEN I find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage WHEN I enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window 
- THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB 
- WHEN I reopen the text editor after closing it 
- THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB 
- WHEN I click on the Install button 
- THEN I download my web application as an icon on my desktop 
- WHEN I load my web application 
- THEN I should have a registered service worker using workbox 
- WHEN I register a service worker 
- THEN I should have my static assets pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets 
- WHEN I deploy to Heroku 
- THEN I should have proper build scripts for a webpack application
